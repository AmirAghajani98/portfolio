    "title": ":About",
    "content": "Hi! I'm 26 years old, and I've been working as a web developer for about three years, with a focus on JavaScript. I earned my bachelor's degree from Islamic Azad University, Qazvin Branch, and currently, I live in Iran. I work at 'KarojoPlus Studio' as a web developer and training manager. Before diving into programming, I worked in content creation and spent some time in the automotive mechanics field. These experiences helped me strengthen my analytical and problem-solving skills, which are now highly beneficial in my software development work. In addition to JavaScript, I've worked with several frameworks and tools that help me deliver projects effectively. One of the things I value most in programming is sharing my knowledge with others and helping new developers grow. My soft skills—such as creative thinking, teamwork, leadership, and ideation—help me collaborate well with my team and create a positive, supportive environment. As an introvert, I feel comfortable working in groups and enjoy finding creative solutions to challenges. The combination of my technical and interpersonal skills has allowed me to succeed both in software development and in my training role."
