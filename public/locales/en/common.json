    "content": "Hi, I have been working in web programming for about three years. Currently, I live in Iran, where I serve as a training manager and web developer at my company. I obtained my bachelor's degree from QIAU University. Before transitioning to programming, I worked in content creation and had a strong interest in automotive mechanics. These experiences helped me develop my analytical and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in my role as a developer. My technical skills include proficiency in multiple programming languages, frameworks, and tools that enhance my development capabilities. In addition to software development, I enjoy sharing knowledge with others and assisting new programmers during training sessions. My soft skills—such as creative thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, and ideation—enable me to communicate and collaborate effectively with my team. As an introverted individual, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy finding creative solutions while contributing to a positive and supportive atmosphere. Overall, my combination of technical expertise and interpersonal skills allows me to excel in both development and training roles."
